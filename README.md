## Idea for business plan outline


1. Create an executive summary (problem, solution)


2. Compose your company description (mission statement, history, objective)


3. Summarize market research and potential (outline your ideal potential customer)
Location, Income, Age, Gender, Education, Profession, Hobbies


4. Conduct competitive analysis (Competitive research begins with identifying other companies that currently sell in the market youâ€™re looking to enter)


5. Describe your product or service (describes the benefits, production process, and life cycle of your products or services, and how what your business offers is better than your competitors)


6. Develop a marketing and sales strategy

You should briefly reiterate topics such as your:
- Value proposition
- Ideal target markets
- Existing customer segments


Then, add your:
- Launch plan to attract new business
- Growth tactics for established businesses to expand
- Retention strategies like customer loyalty or referral programs
- Advertising and promotion channels such as search engines, social media, print, television, YouTube, and word of mouth

You can also use this section of your business plan to reinforce your strengths and what differentiates you from the competition. Be sure to show what you've already done, what you plan to do given your existing resources, and what results you expect from your efforts.

7. Compile your business financials
If you're just starting out, your business may not yet have financial data or comprehensive reporting. You will still need to prepare a budget and a financial plan.

8. Describe your organization and management
 Identify your team members. Highlight expertise and qualifications. Also note roles still need filled, and cost of hiring experts to assist operations.
 Ex:
 Aaron - CEO
 Edutcation if any
 Web Developer - 10 years experience
 Awards and Honors
 Notable Clients

9. Explain your funding request
A new business likely won't have a track record of generating profits. It's possible to sell equity to raise capital in the early stages of operation. Selling equity means selling a portion of the company.

10. Compile an appendix for official documents
Details to cover: 
- Deeds, local permits, and legal documents
  * Business registries, professional licenses invlolving legal structure, state or federal ID numbers
- Certifications that bolster your credibility 
- Patents and intellectual properties
- Industry associations and memberships
- Key customer contracts and purchase orders
